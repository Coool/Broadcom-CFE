This directory is where you typically will import the M-Systems BDK
source tree.  You need to sign a license with M-Systems before
you can get the code, so we're not providing it here.

The file "Makefile" in the parent directory lists specific
object files in the M-Systems BDK that are required for 
CFE's DoC driver.  If the BDK changes you may need to edit
the Makefile.
